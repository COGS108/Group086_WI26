    "How do FAANG companies differ in their daily stock returns and volatility during favorable versus unfavorable market conditions?\n",
    "\n",
    " Using adjusted closing prices, we will calculate daily percentage returns and compare the average returns and standard deviations for each company across different market periods. Market conditions will be defined using benchmark market trends (such as sustained upward or downward movement in the broader stock market). Statistical tests and regression analysis will be used to determine whether certain companies demonstrate greater stability or resilience during downturns. This is an inference-focused analysis that seeks to identify significant differences in performance rather than predict future stock prices.\n",

    "“FAANG” is an slang term which refers to the five most prominent (and best performing) American companies in the tech industry: ‘Facebook’, ‘Apple', ‘Amazon’, ‘Netflix’ and ‘Google’. These companies are among the largest worldwide, boasting a market capitalization of around $12 trillion.[1] Together the companies are worth a fifth of the total value of the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is a stock market index tracking the stocks of 500 leading companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "Over the past decade, FAANG stocks have delivered impressive results, often outperforming the broader market. During bull markets they have been the primary drivers of index growth and when the market has downturns, their immense cash reserves and strong balance sheets help them recover faster than many other competitors. [2] This large influence means that changes in FAANG stock prices can heavily affect the S&P 500’s performance.[1]\n",
    "\t\n",
    "Despite their strong performance, FANG stocks historically have heightened volatility. Volatility refers to the extent to which a stock price fluctuates over time and is commonly used as a measurement of risk. Investors have expressed concerns about overvaluing the FAANG stocks can lead to systemic instability when facing market-wide events. \n",
    "Prior research has extensively examined FAANG’s influence on market indices, overall volatility behavior across market regimes, and the heightened risk characteristics of technology and growth stocks. However, relatively few studies directly compare how the volatility of individual FAANG companies differs across favorable, unfavorable, and stable market conditions, despite substantial differences in their business models and revenue drivers. [2] Analysts have taken note that speedy growth and high valuations in large tech companies can add to instability, in particular during periods of adverse economic conditions where investor behavior shifts in moments. Academic work on the subject also supports the notion that stock behavior alters dependant on the market and whether it is we are seeing bull, bear, or stable conditions. However, much fewer studies offer a direct comparison for how each individual FAANG company’s volatility may be different across various market regimes, despite their distinct business models.\n",
    "While FAANG companies are often grouped together, less is known about whether their stock volatility responds similarly to different market conditions or whether company-specific characteristics lead to distinct risk profiles. In this project, we will quantify volatility using daily log returns and compare how each FAANG company’s volatility changes across market regimes. The daily log return will be used to identify how much the stock moved each day which will then be used to quantify volatility through the standard deviation. Market conditions will be classified using the S&P 500’s return distribution (or VIX levels), allowing us to test whether volatility responses differ significantly between companies. VIX measures the market's expectation of 30-day volatility for the S&P 500. A VIX value greater than 30 indicates market fear and uncertainty, while values below 20 suggest stability. \n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that FAANG companies with more diversified revenue streams, such as Amazon and Apple, will exhibit lower volatility and smaller negative daily returns during unfavorable market conditions compared to companies that rely more heavily on advertising or subscription-based revenue. Because diversified firms are generally less sensitive to shocks in any single sector, they are expected to show greater stability when the overall market declines."

    "\n",
    "   - The variables needed would be:\n",
    "      - Date\n",
    "      - Opening and closing price for the stock\n",
    "      - Adjusted closing price for each stock\n",
    "      - Daily trading volume\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The dataset should have at least 10 years of daily data, with approximately 2,500–3,000 observations per stock. This length is necessary to capture multiple phases of the market, including periods of stability and market stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The data would be collected from public financial markets, where prices and volumes are recorded at the close of each trading day. Market benchmark and riskiness data would be collected from established financial and economic data providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The data would be stored in a table  with dates as rows and variables as columns. Stock-level data can be organized either with one row per stock per day or with one column per stock’s returns, depending on the analysis.\n",

This dataset includes stock data from earlier “normal” market conditions as well as later years. This makes it useful as a baseline for comparison, allowing analysis of how stock behavior differs between stable economic periods and disruptive events.\n",

Typical variables are Date, Open, High, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. These variables let us analyze how the stock prices of major tech companies changed during the pandemic period and can be used in trend analysis or regression models that include pandemic effects.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " \n",
    " Although stock data itself is objective, limiting the analysis to FAANG companies introduces selection bias because these firms are unusually large and influential. Our findings may not generalize to smaller technology companies or other sectors.\n",
    "\n",

    " - [] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",

    "\n",
    "Focusing only on stock performance may overlook broader economic factors such as government policy, global events, or industry disruptions. We will acknowledge these external influences when interpreting results.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Market conditions and time period selection could influence conclusions. To reduce this risk, we will use at least 10 years of data to capture multiple economic cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations and summary statistics will be designed to accurately reflect the data without exaggerating trends or selectively presenting results.\n",

    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider multiple metrics such as returns, volatility, and trading volume rather than relying on a single measure, ensuring a more balanced evaluation of company performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical methods used (e.g., regression and comparative statistics) are interpretable, allowing us to clearly explain how conclusions were reached.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",

    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
