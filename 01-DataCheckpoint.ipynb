Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",

    "###Amazon Stock Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains daily stock price information for Amazon from multiple years, including variables such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. Prices are recorded in U.S. dollars (USD) and represent the value of one share of Amazon stock at the opening, highest, lowest, or closing of each trading day. The Adjusted Close accounts for corporate actions like stock splits and dividends, providing a consistent measure for calculating daily returns. Volume indicates the number of shares traded each day, giving insight into market activity and liquidity. Key metrics for our analysis are the Adjusted Close and Volume. From the Adjusted Close, we calculate daily percentage returns and daily log returns, which are used to measure the stock’s volatility over time. Volatility is quantified as the standard deviation of daily log returns, with higher values indicating larger day-to-day price fluctuations. Trading volume, while not directly part of return calculations, can indicate periods of increased market interest or stress, which may correlate with higher volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations: The dataset only includes Amazon stock and lacks broader market benchmarks like the S&P 500 or VIX, which are needed to define market conditions. It is limited to daily prices, omitting intraday fluctuations, and does not include external factors such as macroeconomic events or company news that could affect volatility. Additionally, because Amazon is a large tech company, its behavior may not generalize to smaller firms or other sectors."

Also, stock data often shows **non-stationarity** (long-term trend changes over time), and early trading periods (e.g., IPO era) can have unusually high volatility.
